**Below is the planning for the two days of TD on quantitative genetics:**    

**DAY 1 (November 7th, 2-5 PM)**  

**2-3PM:** Presentation of the simulation tool, brief description of the functions, and some hands-on practice (The Readme.md is a markdown file that will guide you step by step).   
**3-4PM (including 15-minute break):** Setting up the software environment: downloading the simulation script, running toy simulations. 
**4-5PM:** Project presentations. A list of 6 projects will be presented to the students; 6 groups will be defined and students will start working on their project. 

**DAY 2 (November 9th, 2-5PM)**  

**2-3:30PM:** Exploration of the scientific questions associated with the project (simulations and graphs). 
**3:30-5PM (including 15-minute break):** Preparation of the figures (objective: 3 figures exploring different parameters).
